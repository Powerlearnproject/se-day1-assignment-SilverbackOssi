Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- software engineering is a the craft of designing computer programs that solve specific problems

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- personal computers
- internet
- Ai

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirement gathering phase
- Design phase
- Implemntation phase
- Testing phase
- Deployment phase
- Maintenance phase

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- The Waterfall methodology for software development is a rigid technique that allows software developers to take problems through the SDLC at a stretch; when one phase in the software development lifecycle is completed, it is not revisited until the final phase. On the other hand, Agile methodology is a paradigm that allows developers flexibily, development is done modularly in sprint itereations; this allows requirements to be revisited at the start of every new sprint.
- The waterfall methodology is appropriate when all the requirements of a software is known beforehand. While the agile methodology is appropriate for software development where the requirements might need to be revisited, and speed is priority.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developers role in the team is to implement the design of the software into functional code.
- The Quality Assurance Engineers role is to test fully the resulting product, ensuring it is bug free and meets all requirements.
- The Project Manager organizes and manages the entire Software development lifecycle, ensuring all team roles are functioning appropriately and the project is progressing within timeframe and budget.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- Promt engineering is the art of crafting precise and robust prompts that query AI models, to ensure it outputs desired results.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
- Prompt: generate an image of a cat
- Improved promt: generate ..
- Here the improved prompt is more effective because it...
